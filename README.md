# Refs App
Refs is a service for developing creativity through photo tutorials. In addition to the [web version](https://github.com/HSEADC/B21DZ09-L3-Project-04) Refs now has an iOS mobile app that is almost ready for release and upload to the App Store. Now it's even easier to participate in photo sessions and develop your creativity.
